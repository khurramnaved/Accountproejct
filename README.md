# 🧾 Account Project

This repository contains a Python-based **Account Management System**, designed to handle tasks like tracking balances, managing transactions, or running finance-related operations. The main logic is contained in the `main.py` file, which this script (`accountproject.py`) launches directly.

- 💸 Add, update, and delete financial transactions
- 📊 View account balances and summaries
- 📁 Store and retrieve account data
- 🧮 Calculate totals, averages, or financial stats
- 🖥️ Simple command-line or GUI-based interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- File I/O or Database (e.g., SQLite, JSON)
- Optional: Pandas, Tkinter, Flask, etc.
